# Preproc_Effects
hosted scripts for building templates, priors, and pre-processing data

Basic Notes: 
1) Scripts that start with "MT" are used for creating a template.
2) Scripts that start with "PP" are used in the pre-processing pipeline.
3) Scripts are numbered (e.g. *_1.sh, *_2.sh) to indicate their respective step in the pipeline.
