# Preproc_Effects
Hosted scripts for building templates, template priors, pre-processing data, extraction ROI volumes, and running a tensor-based morphometric analysis

Basic Notes: 
1) Scripts that start with "MT" are used for creating a template.
2) Scripts that start with "PP" are used in the pre-processing pipeline.
3) Scripts are numbered (e.g. *_1.sh, *_2.sh) to indicate their respective step in the pipeline.
